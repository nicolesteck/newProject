# Individual Project - LinkedIn Notes
Madison College Enterprise Java<br />Spring 2018<br />Nicole Steck

## Problem Statement
 
For those of us starting out our careers in this competitive society, building a network of individuals with whom
you share professional interests, experiences, or goals is a vital part of the process. However, it's all too easy to 
build a pool of connections on professional networking sites such as LinkedIn, only to realize months or years down 
the line that you can no longer remember why you connected with many of those people.
<br /><br />Without the ability to recollect the reasons behind your connections, you can no longer utilize those 
important connections. <br />

## Solution 
LinkedIn's already vital functionality will be strengthened with the user's ability to make notes on their contacts that can include context, 
background, and other vital data. This application will allow users to contextualize all of their contacts, including 
logging previous interactions, action items, and other salient details. This will build LinkedIn out and make it a 
truly necessary application for job seekers and career builders.
